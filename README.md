Elevator System for displaying different elevator algorithms and the efficiency of the respective algorithms.

WORK IN PROGRESS

# Short term goals:
## P0:
* get core logic working with one elevator system in 2-3 story building
* generate random people with destinations randomly throughout building
* have elevator use FIFO priority system
* have optional system out display to quickly display results

## P1:
* get core logic to support X elevator system for Y story building
* allow support for different types of algorithms by central elevator runner
* set up different environments (rather than randomly generating people in random floors with random destinations)
** simulate morning, where majority of people are generated at first floor to random destinations
** simulate lunch, where random generation of floors to same general destination

## P2:
* improve UI so we can see individual aspects of entire system
** people on each floor/destinations, occupants in elevators, elevator state... etc
** pause/resume feature

## P3:
* have computer determine its own version of an efficient solution for different types of environments
* display good analysis of results

## P4:
* make a game out of this lol.
